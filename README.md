# Satellite-Orbit-and-Collision-Simulation
Designed and created an orbit and collision modeling app for the MIT Space Propulsion Lab STEP-1 cube-sat mission planned for 2026. The app was coded in Python and FreeFlyer script and uses FreeFlyer's runtime API to run simulations and Space-Track.org's REST API to pull in satellite data. Tkinter was used to create a GUI.
